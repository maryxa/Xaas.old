XAllegro C++ Web Application Framework

Designed to get easier developing of web apps using the most advanced patterns:

 - 100% object-oriented coding: increased understanding, maintenance and evolution of the code.
 - MVC model-view-controlled implementation: split page output / code algorithm.
 - Modular, scalar, extensible design, making each component independent.
 - HTML5-CSS3 compliance: the view module (XSLT) implements HTML5, making form generation and validation easier.
 - Control: web pages accessible from both CGI interface and Web Services.
 - Security: automatic security checks performed on libraries’ calling.
 - C++ standard: our framework is based on C++11 aka C++0x and is fully portable over different operating systems.
 - OS-Platform: Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Raspberry
 - Memory management with SmartPointer
 - Configration: One Configuration File

Built-in operation’s library with no-coding security checks:

 - HTTP requests: providing API to read parameters from GET or POST HTTP requests performing internal security checks.
 - Database abstraction layer: joining communications between code and databases provides a single API to execute and manage different operations, giving independence to the code from the database engine.
 - Database qeury: collections support for Result Set (via std:map).
 - Super Globals Variables: REQUEST, RESPONSE and Web Services.
 - Databse Partitioning: multiples database configuration (Session and authentication, Read, Write).
 - XML manipulation: ready-to-go methods to manipulate XML objects performing various operations as converting strings and/or files to DOM, counting nodes, evaluating XPath expressions etc.
 - XSLT parsing: platform-independent methods to parse XML strings, files or documents, setting XSL values which results into HTML text.
 - Client-server side encryption to protect HTTP communication from the client to the server, including SHA, AES, DES via OpenSSL.
 - Session Management: the framework comes with methods to manage single-sign-on sessions and cookies between Apps sharing the same framework.
 - Detailed and flexible Authentication-Permissions-ACL: unlimited users, GUI to set role-based permissions and ACL.
 - Translations: unlimited languages and GUI-guided translation, so to ease internationalisation and localisation.
 - Dropdown-boxes management: fully GUI-manageable option list in dropdown boxes stored in a single database table.
 - Logging: built-in methods defining different logging levels.
 - Outbound calls with Curl and sockets: handling of Curl calls to external websites managing responses or TCP/IP sockets with external servers.
 - Mail: ready-to-use methods to send emails.
 - Error and info page: automatic methods to generate error and info messages.
 - Character encoding: multiple UTF-8 characters dealing with XML entities and special characters, simplifying conversion to or from URL or Base64, etc.
 - Time Functions: ready-to-use methods to manipulate dates
 - Currency Management
 - Casting: Ready to use casting method
 - Xml Web Services: ready to go Controller and Interfaces to publish Xml Web Services
 
Raspberry PI:
- GPIOs : ready-to-use methods to control GPIO
- UART : ready-to-use methods for UART

Ease of learning, featuring:

 - Design patterns: that means the framework is quick, easy to learn and ready to use.
 - Detailed knowledge of the system not required.
 - Selective learning: thanks to modular design and model-view-controlled patterns, programmers would need to learn only selected functions relative to their project goal, scope and role.
